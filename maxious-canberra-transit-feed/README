=== Introduction === 

This distribution contains everything required to build a basic google transit 
feed for Canberra, Australia. 

Requirements: GNU Make, Perl, Python 2.5, PHP, Ruby, libpq (postgres-devel package on Fedora), postgres,json gem for Ruby, libyaml and pyyaml for Python

=== Usage ===

First, grab a copy of google transit feed tools:

cd $HOME/src
wget http://googletransitdatafeed.googlecode.com/files/transitfeed-1.2.6.tar.gz
tar zxvf transitfeed-1.2.6.tar.gz

Either install it properly or set PYTHONPATH to the python directory in the above checkout:

export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/src/transitfeed-1.2.6/python

You then need the input html and postgis/postgres database.
TO get the html, run the get.sh script in source-html
To get the postgres up and running, use the dump provided in db.sql.gz and
put login details into the various scripts

Then just type "make" to build the feed. The output at the end is "feed.zip".
For fun, you can view this feed using the snazzy transit feed view application:

$HOME/src/transitfeed-1.2.6/python/schedule_viewer.py --feed=cbrfeed.zip
